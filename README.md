# Dog_Age_Calculator

A simple few line sof code which will allow you to enter your dog's age and converts it to the quivelant human age

Made as part of my course, as with anything I like to add my own twist and made this slightly more advanced than we were required to. Original challenge was to code a calculator which asks the user for their dog's age and then tell them how old the dog would be if it was a human. I improved this by not only asking for the age of the dog, but asking for the user's name and also the dog's name to make it feel a little bit more personal.

Once I learn how ti integrate JavaScript with HTML and CSS I will make this into a functional and interactive website for people to try for themselves.

--- How this works ---

User is prompted for their name, their dog's name and their dog's age

The code then spits out an alert saying "OK (user's name), (dog's names) is (X) years old in human years!"
